# Gaussian Elimination

## AIM:
To write a program to find the solution of a matrix using Gaussian Elimination.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
### step 1
First,we want to import numpy,then import sys,assume a variable.
### step 2
For gaussian elimination method, we want to make 2nd and 3rd column zero.
### step 3
For that we want to make a range accorting to our program output.
### step 4
Then print the program with correct form then the output will display.
## Program:
```

import numpy as np
import sys

n=int(input())
a=np.zeros((n,n+1))
x=np.zeros(n)

for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n+1):
        a[i][j] = float(input())
        
        
for i in range(n):
    if a[i][j] == 0.0:
        sys.exit('Divide by zero detected')
        
    for j in range(i+1,n):
        ratio = a[j][i]/a[i][i]
        
        for k in range(n+1):
           a[j][k] = a[j][k]-ratio*a[i][k]
           
x[n-1] = a[n-1][n]/a[n-1][n-1]

for i in range(n-2,-1,-1):
    x[i] = a[i][n]
    
    for j in range(i+1,n):
        x[i] = x[i] - a[i][j]*x[j]
        
    x[i]= x[i]/a[i][i]
    
    
for i in range(n):
    print('X%d = %0.2f' %(i,x[i]), end=' ')
    
```

## Result:
Thus the program to find the solution of a matrix using Gaussian Elimination is written and verified using python programming.
